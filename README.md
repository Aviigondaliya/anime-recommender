# Anime Recommender

Anime Recommender is a personalized anime recommendation system built using Flask, scikit-learn, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. It leverages cosine similarity to provide users with tailored anime suggestions based on their preferences.

## Technology

- **Flask:** The web application framework used to develop the user interface and handle user requests.

- **scikit-learn:** The machine learning library used for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculation.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Utilizes scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to transform anime features into TF-IDF vectors, capturing their unique characteristics.

- **Cosine Similarity:** Recommendations are generated by calculating cosine similarity between the user's input and the anime features.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web application provides an intuitive interface for users to input their genre preferences, preferred number of episodes, and score range.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The system generates personalized anime recommendations based on the user's input, making it suitable for a diverse range of anime preferences.
